	<head><h1>About Me</h1></head>
<body> 
I'm a freelance writer and editor; I live in Hong Kong, though I am originally from the UK. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I am increasingly being asked by clients to provide website content, and I want to learn more about the process and structure of websites, just in the way that I understand the mechanics behind newspaper and magazine design and printing. 

<h2>My Mission</h2>

<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to be able to increase the proportion of work on websites and to promote myself as an experienced provider of website content. In the future, I would consider designing websites for small local companies in a range of fields including e-retailing, health and fitness, art and design, etc.</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>

<p>This is how I have evolved professionally:
<ul>
<li><strong>Sub-editor, Chief sub-editor,</strong> Radio Times (British Broadcasting Company)<br>
London, UK, 1978-1984</li>

<li><strong>Consultant Editor,</strong> CDN Publishing Ltd<br>
Hong Kong, 1994-1998</li>

<li><strong>Owner,</strong> Write On writing and publishing services<br>
Hong Kong, 1990-present</li>
</ul>

<h2>Education</h2>
<li><strong>Stafford Girls' High School,</strong> UK (1964-1971); <em>8 O-levels, 2 A-levels</em></li>
<li><strong>University of London,</strong> UK (1971-1975); <em>BA Hons (Geography)</em></li>

<h2>Other</h2>
<p>In my spare time I like to draw and paint, particularly landscapes and urban environments, and I'm a member of Urban Sketchers Hong Kong group; visit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/urbansketchers">Urban Sketchers</a>.
	I would love to be able to design my own website so that I can share my artistic endeavours with the rest of the world!</p>
