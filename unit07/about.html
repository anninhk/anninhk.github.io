<h3>About page - a work in progress</h3>

<article>

<p>I am a freelance writer and editor based in Hong Kong, specializing in writing materials for corporates, educational institutions and contract publishers.</p> <br>

<p>Before arriving in Hong Kong, I worked for a range of big-name media titles in London, including the BBC’s Radio Times (Britain’s largest selling weekly, then 4m circulation), the Independent, Daily Telegraph, Sunday Telegraph, Which? magazine, and the London Illustrated News.</p><br>

<p>I believe I was the first female sports sub-editor to work in Fleet Street, while at the Daily Telegraph.</p><br>

<p>Hong Kong has been my home since 1988. I initially worked at the South China Morning Post  before joining The Peak, a monthly lifestyle magazine, where my duties included that of food editor.</p><br>

<p>Having gained extensive editorial experience to the highest standards of professionalism, accuracy and speed, I set up Write On in 1990 to provide English language writing services.</p> <br>

<p>
From 1999-2003 I worked on a freelance basis as the fashion editor of B International, an English-language monthly women’s lifestyle magazine in Hong Kong, showcasing the latest international trends and personalities, as well as covering the local fashion scene.</p><br>

<p>During 2007 and 2008, I was an editorial co-ordinator producing the Fair Daily publication for various trade fairs run by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. At the time eight of these fairs were the biggest of their kind in Asia and three were the biggest in the world. This required managing a team of eight-plus members, namely designers, photographers and writers, producing a magazine printed overnight for distribution at the fairground before opening time the following day. </p><br>

<p>In 20xx I was commissioned to produce the editorial content for the 25th anniversary mini-website of Hong Kong-based airline Dragonair. I am currently the writer/editor of Dragonair’s bi-monthly staff newsletter, as well as writing for other organisations in the Cathay Pacific Group, including Asia Miles and Cathay Pacific Cargo Terminal.</p> <br>

<p>Hong University of Science & Technology is currently ranked…. In the xxxx. I write the English-language content of its twice-yearly alumni magazine. This involves interpreting the methodologies and findings of scientific research projects into layman’s language.</p><br>
