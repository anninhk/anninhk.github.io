<h3>Ann Williams</h3>
<p>I am a freelance writer and editor based in Hong Kong, specializing in writing materials for corporates, educational institutions and contract publishers.</p> 
<p>Between  1978 and 1987 I worked for a range of big-name media titles in London, including the BBC’s <i>Radio Times</i> (Britain’s largest selling weekly, then 4m circulation), <i>Independent</i>, <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, <i>Sunday Telegraph</i>, <i>Which?</i> magazine, and <i>London Illustrated News</i>.</p>

<p>I believe I was the first female sports sub-editor in Fleet Street, when I worked on the sports desk of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has been my home since 1988. I initially worked at the <i>South China Morning Post</i> before joining <i>The Peak</i>, a monthly lifestyle magazine, as an editor/writer.</p>

<h3>Write On Landmarks</h3>

<p>I set up Write On in 1990 to provide English-language writing services for a range of clients, including magazines and newspapers, PR agencies, corporates, government bodies and educational institutions.</p> <br><br>

<h4>Fashion Forward</h4>
<p>
From 1999-2003 I worked on a freelance basis as the fashion editor of B International, an English-language monthly women’s lifestyle magazine in Hong Kong, showcasing the latest international trends and personalities, as well as covering the local fashion scene.</p><br>

<h4>Fair Dues</h4>
<p>During 2007 and 2008, I was an editorial co-ordinator producing the Fair Daily publication for various trade fairs run by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. At the time eight of these fairs were the biggest of their kind in Asia and three were the biggest in the world. This required managing a team of eight-plus members, namely designers, photographers and writers, producing a magazine printed overnight for distribution at the fairground before opening time the following day. </p><br>

<h4>Flying High</h4>
<p>In 2010 I was commissioned to produce the editorial content for the 25th anniversary mini-website of Hong Kong-based airline Dragonair. I am currently the writer/editor of Dragonair’s bi-monthly staff newsletter, as well as writing for other organisations in the Cathay Pacific Group, including Asia Miles and Cathay Pacific Cargo Terminal.</p> <br>

<h4>Educating Readers</h4>
<p>Hong Kong University of Science & Technology is currently ranked…. In the xxxx. I write the English-language content of its twice-yearly alumni magazine. This involves interpreting the methodologies and findings of scientific research projects into layman’s language.</p><br>
