<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size and balance?</h1><p>
thegreensoccerjournal.com is a single-page website that markets The Green Soccer Journal, a print publication that seeks to combine "beautiful photography and intelligent journalism" on the subject of world football. Its photography is particulary strong, using eye-catching portraiture of players, rather than "action" shots. The website reflects this in its layout and content.</p>
<p>The page is dark, filled completely with a headshot, overlaid with white type, for the magazine's "masthead" located top left, justified left, and the "stand-first" describing the cover story, centred on the page towards the bottom of the screen. A neon green "buy" button is located here, too. The page scrolls horizontally to reveal other stories in the current issue, in the same style as the cover, and vertically to show front covers of various issues with a "buy" button below each. Further down is the "About" page declaring the magazine's mission statement in relatively large black type on a white background, centred on the page but justified left. "Where to buy" list locations in three columns in smaller white type on a black background. Contact and link information is at the bottom in small black text centred on a white background, .</p>

<p>backpagefootball.com is an online magazine about world football. Its name is inspired by the "back sports pages" of print newspapers. As such, the website features a traditional newspaper-style layout, with a distinct masthead and thick and thin horizontal lines dividing sections, and distinct columns (though of varying widths). A rolling banner across the width of the page at the top, highlights the latest stories with photos and standfirsts. </p>
<p>The first column features thumbnail pix, surrounded by white space, illustrating the feature stories and linked to the headlines and standfirsts in the next, widest, column. The third, narrowest, column has a strong vertical feel, with big captions in white on grey describing the photos above. The final column features links to the podcast and various videos, among other stories, divided by section headings. All the stories/visuals link to the full-length features. The index at the bottom balances the banner at the top, with three columns of white text on a grey background. The flow of the entire page is similar to how a traditional newspaper is read: left to right, top to bottom. Its look is  similar to theguardian.com, the award-winning website of the Guardian newspaper.</p>

<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>
<p>thegreensoccerjournal.com is very clean, despite its dark appearance; visuals are very strong and text is very limited; backpagefootball is much busier, but the white background and neat grid/column layout with a strong flow makes it easy to pick out the different elements. The different layouts are very much a reflection of the function and purpose of each website. Greensoccer drew me in because of its strong opening photo of a man's face filling the screen (even before I knew it was about football). Backpagefootball's appeal is much more content driven, but because it is well-balanced with enough white space and a strong flow, it is not confusing but clear and concise.</p>
